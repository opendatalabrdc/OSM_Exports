OpenStreetMap RDC Exports

## Data Repository
The [Data](data) Repository contains files for the Latest OSM Exports tables extracted, this for each feature. We plan regular updates. Note that more frequent updates will be available when intense editing or special needs to support humanitarian emergencies.

Geodata Files are available for both CSV and GeoJSON formats. The tables are structured to let visualize simultaneously points and polygons in QGIS and similar Map View tools. For both CSV and GeoJSON formats, the type variable let's group data in two layers (ie. points and polygons). At the same time, the lat and lon variables (latitude and longitude coordinates) are available. This offers more flexibility for both viewing and analyzing the data.
